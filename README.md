In this project, I practice web scraping with Ruby gem nokogiri.

<ol>

  <li>In the app.rb program, I scrape a list of all cryptocurrency symbols and values from https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/ and associate them in a hash.<li>

  <li>In the mairies.rb program, I scrape the email addresses of all town halls in the Val d'Oise department and associate them in a hash.<li>

  <li>In the deputies.rb program, I scrape the names and emails addresses of all 600+ deputies to the French parliament and return an array of hashes with each deputy's first name, last name and email address. (FYI: This program takes approximately 5 minutes to run!)<li>
